### Dijkstra Algorithm implementation in TypeScript and JavaScript

#### The Dijkstra Algorithm is a Path finding algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two `nodes` in a `graph`.
- It fans away from the starting node by visiting the next node of the lowest weight and continues to do so until the next node of the lowest weight is the end node.
